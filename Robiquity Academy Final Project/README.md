# Vendor Invoice Processing Automation
The purpose of this process is to automate the creation of invoices for each transaction of each vendor, but only if the vendor has approved the processing of their invoices. All vendor and invoice data is saved in both the Orchestrator Queues and the Database server. Once the invoices have been processed, the robot will create and compress each vendor folder and send it to them via email. Additionally, the program generates an MIS report at the end of the process, while ensuring the queue and the database are updated for each transaction accordingly.
